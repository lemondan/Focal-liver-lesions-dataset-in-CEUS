Focal-liver-lesions-dataset-in-CEUS
===================================

We publish our SYSU-CEUS dataset, which consists of three types of FLLs: 186 HCC instances, 109 HEM instances and 58 FNH instances (i.e.,186 malignant instances and 167 benign instances). 

This dataset is collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. The equipment used was Aplio SSA-770A (Toshiba Medical
System).

All these instances with resolution 768*576 were taken from different patients, with large variations in appearance and enhancement patterns (e.g. sizes, contrasts, shapes and
locations) of the FLLs.
